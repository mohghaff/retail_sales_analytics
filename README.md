Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Dataset Documentation
Overview
The Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Dataset is a synthetic dataset that simulates a dynamic retail environment. It focuses on retail sales and customer characteristics, providing an opportunity to explore intricate patterns, draw insights, and gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior.

Dataset Details
The dataset captures essential attributes that drive retail operations and customer interactions. It includes key details such as:

Transaction ID
Date
Customer ID
Gender
Age
Product Category
Quantity
Price per Unit
Total Amount
These attributes enable a multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviors.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted using pandas and numpy to unravel patterns and insights in the data. The EDA process involved:

Checking for null values
Descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of numerical columns
Grouping data by different categories to understand the influence of factors like age and gender on purchasing behavior
Time series analysis to discern patterns in sales across different time periods
Correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different variables

Dashboard Creation
After the EDA, a dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize the findings and make the data more accessible. The dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the data and uncover insights.

Questions Explored
The EDA and dashboard creation process aimed to answer several questions:

How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?
Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?
Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences?
